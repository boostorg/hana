> Your standard library for metaprogramming

## Disclaimers
__This is now an official Boost library!__ The results of the formal review
can be seen [here](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.boost.devel/261740).
However, the library is still not included in a Boost release, and API stability is still not assured.


## Overview
<!-- Important: keep this in sync with example/overview.cpp -->
```cpp
#include <boost/hana.hpp>
#include <boost/hana/ext/std/type_traits.hpp>
#include <cassert>
#include <string>
namespace hana = boost::hana;
using namespace hana::literals;

struct Fish { std::string name; };
struct Cat  { std::string name; };
struct Dog  { std::string name; };

int main() {
  // Sequences capable of holding heterogeneous objects, and algorithms
  // to manipulate them.
  auto animals = hana::make_tuple(Fish{"Nemo"}, Cat{"Garfield"}, Dog{"Snoopy"});
  auto names = hana::transform(animals, [](auto a) {
    return a.name;
  });
  assert(hana::reverse(names) == hana::make_tuple("Snoopy", "Garfield", "Nemo"));

  // No compile-time information is lost: even if `animals` can't be a
  // constant expression because it contains strings, its length is constexpr.
  static_assert(hana::length(animals) == 3u, "");

  // Computations on types can be performed with the same syntax as that of
  // normal C++. Believe it or not, everything is done at compile-time.
  auto animal_types = hana::make_tuple(hana::type_c<Fish*>, hana::type_c<Cat&>, hana::type_c<Dog*>);
  auto animal_ptrs = hana::filter(animal_types, [](auto a) {
    return hana::traits::is_pointer(a);
  });
  static_assert(animal_ptrs == hana::make_tuple(hana::type_c<Fish*>, hana::type_c<Dog*>), "");

  // And many other goodies to make your life easier, including:
  // 1. Access to elements in a tuple with a sane syntax.
  static_assert(animal_ptrs[0_c] == hana::type_c<Fish*>, "");
  static_assert(animal_ptrs[1_c] == hana::type_c<Dog*>, "");

  // 2. Unroll loops at compile-time without hassle.
  std::string s;
  hana::int_c<10>.times([&]{ s += "x"; });
  // equivalent to s += "x"; s += "x"; ... s += "x";

  // 3. Easily check whether an expression is valid.
  //    This is usually achieved with complex SFINAE-based tricks.
  auto has_name = hana::is_valid([](auto&& x) -> decltype((void)x.name) { });
  static_assert(has_name(animals[0_c]), "");
  static_assert(!has_name(1), "");
}
```


## Documentation
You can browse the documentation online at http://ldionne.github.io/hana.
You can also get an offline version of the documentation by checking out
the `gh-pages` branch. To avoid overwriting the current directory, you
can clone the `gh-pages` branch into a subdirectory like `doc/gh-pages`:
```shell
git clone http://github.com/ldionne/hana --branch=gh-pages doc/gh-pages
```

After issuing this, `doc/gh-pages` will contain exactly the same static
website that's available online. Note that `doc/gh-pages` is automatically
ignored by git so updating the documentation won't pollute your index.


## Hacking on Hana
Setting yourself up to work on Hana is easy. First, you will need an
installation of [CMake][]. Once this is done, you can `cd` to the root
of the project and setup the build directory:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Usually, you'll want to specify a custom compiler because the system's
compiler is too old:
```shell
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/compiler
```

Usually, this will work just fine. However, on some systems, the standard
library provided by default does not support C++14. In this case, you
basically have two choices. The first one is to install a more recent standard
library system-wide, which might or might not be possible. The second choice
is to install a more recent standard library locally, and to tell Hana to use
this standard library instead of the system one. To do so, you must specify

1. A custom header search path. This instructs the compiler to look for
   headers in the `/path/to/std-includes` directory. This way, when you
   `#include <type_traits>`, for example, it will look for that header in
   the `/path/to/std-includes` directory.
   ```shell
   export CXXFLAGS="-I /path/to/std-includes"
   ```

2. A custom library search path and library to link against. This instructs
   the linker to search for libraries in the `/path/to/std-library` directory,
   and to link against the `std-library` library, which should be present in
   the directory you provided.
   ```shell
   export LDFLAGS="-L /path/to/std-library -l std-library"
   ```

3. A custom search path for loading shared libraries at runtime. This will be
   looked up by your program at startup time.
   ```shell
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/path/to/std-library"
  ```

For example, using a custom libc++ on my Linux box looks like:
```shell
export CXXFLAGS="-I ${HOME}/code/llvm36/build/include/c++/v1"
export LDFLAGS="-L ${HOME}/code/llvm36/build/lib -l c++ -l c++abi"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${HOME}/code/llvm36/build/lib"
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-3.6
```

Normally, Hana tries to find Boost headers if you have them on your system.
It's also fine if you don't have them; a few tests requiring the Boost headers
will be disabled in that case. However, if you'd like Hana to use a custom
installation of Boost, you can specify the path to this custom installation:
```shell
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/compiler -DBOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost
```

You can now build and run the unit tests and the examples. Assuming you
used the Makefile generator with CMake, you can issue
```shell
make check
```

> #### Tip
> There is a Makefile at the root of the project which forwards everything
> to the `build` directory. This way, you can also issue those commands from

You should be aware that compiling the unit tests is pretty time and RAM
consuming, especially the tests for external adapters. This is due to the
fact that Hana's unit tests are very thorough, and also that heterogeneous
sequences in other libraries tend to have horrible compile-time performance.

There are also optional targets which are enabled only when the required
software is available on your computer. For example, generating the
documentation requires [Doxygen][] to be installed. An informative message
will be printed during the CMake generation step whenever an optional target
is disabled. You can install any missing software and then re-run the CMake
generation to update the list of available targets.

> #### Tip
> You can use the `help` target to get a list of all the available targets.

If you want to add unit tests or examples, just add a source file in `test/`
or `example/` and then re-run the CMake generation step so the new source
file is known to the build system. Let's suppose the relative path from the
root of the project to the new source file is `path/to/file.cpp`. When you
re-run the CMake generation step, a new target named `path.to.file` will be
created, and a test of the same name will also be created. Hence,
```shell
make path.to.file # Compiles the unit test associated to path/to/file.cpp
cd build && ctest path.to.file # Runs the corresponding unit test
```

> #### Tip for Sublime Text users
> If you use the provided [hana.sublime-project](hana.sublime-project) file,
> you can select the "[Hana] Build current file" build system. When viewing a
> file to which a target is associated (like a test or an example), you can
> then compile it by pressing ⌘B, or compile and then run it using ⇧⌘B.


## Project organization
The project is organized in a couple of subdirectories.
- The [benchmark](benchmark) directory contains compile-time and runtime
  benchmarks to make sure the library is as fast as advertised. The benchmark
  code is written mostly in the form of [eRuby][] templates. The templates
  are used to generate C++ files which are then compiled while gathering
  compilation and execution statistics.
- The [cmake](cmake) directory contains various CMake modules and other
  scripts needed by the build system.
- The [doc](doc) directory contains configuration files needed to generate
  the documentation. The `doc/gh-pages` subdirectory is automatically ignored
  by git; you can conveniently store a local copy of the documentation by
  cloning the gh-pages branch into that directory, as explained above.
- The [example](example) directory contains the source code for all the
  examples of both the tutorial and the reference documentation.
- The [include](include) directory contains the library itself, which is
  header only.
- The [test](test) directory contains the source code for all the unit tests.

I also wrote my bachelor's thesis on a formalization of C++ metaprogramming
through category theory and Hana. It is available [here][thesis], but
unfortunately it is in french only. I also presented [a talk][slides.thesis]
on this formalization for my bachelor's thesis (french only).
